# sqlalchemy-challenge
Getting ready for a long holiday vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii! For this project we are doing:

-Climate Analysis and Exploration

-Climate App

-Temperature Analysis

-Daily Rainfall Average

Climate Analysis and Exploration:

using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database.

Precipitation Analysis:

• Designing a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

• Selecting only the date and prcp values.

• Loading the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

• Plotting the results using the DataFrame plot method.

• Using Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

Station Analysis:

• Designing a query to calculate the total number of stations.

• Designing a query to find the most active stations.

• Designing a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

Climate App:

designing a Flask API based on the queries that we have just developed.

• A dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value.

• A list of stations from the dataset.

• The dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.

• List of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for all dates greater than and equal to the given date.

• List of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for dates between the given start date and given end date.


Final some analysis:

1. The station 'USC00519281' has highest amount of rows with 2772.
2. Precipation data is fluctuated with Previous to current year of data set.
